## üî¨ How It Works

1. **Setup**: Caregiver programs medication schedule via app or device interface.
2. **Dispense**: At scheduled time, carousel rotates to correct blister pack slot.
3. **Notify**: Buzzer, LED, and OLED display prompt the patient.
4. **Verify**: LDR sensor checks pill removal. If not taken within ~5 minutes ‚Üí caregiver notified.
5. **Log & Analyze**: Data stored locally and synced to the app, AI detects trends for predictive adherence support.
